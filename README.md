# Advent of Code 2025

Only 12 days this year.

I'm going to attempt it in Racket this time.

I got 100% in a year for the first time !

## Roundup

I liked that AoC had no global leaderboard this year and that there were only 12 days, even if it took me until the 31st (as opposed to the actual final day which was the 12th) to get the final answer.

As for learning Racket, even though I can see a lot of power in it, I don't see myself using it again.  I found it very verbose and rather inside-out and back to front compared to all the other languages I've ever used which were much more left to right (to me).  I found the DrRacket Editor/IDE a little frustrating, but I have a lot muscle memory in `vi` so I am biased.  My code wasn't very idiomatic Racket, so I wouldn't recommend copying any of the code in here.

I can see some value in Lisp and/or functional programming (FP), I like chaining functions together, it feels a little bit like a unix shell pipeline sequence.

An example of the verbosity I mentioned is:

`i++` or `i+=1` versus `(set! i (add1 i))`
